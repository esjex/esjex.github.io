# Siobhan Fitzgerald-Gibson

## Technical Writer & Editor

Hello! I'm Siobhan.

I'm a human-focused technical writer and editor who believes that **good documentation makes people's lives easier**. 

I specialise in clear, scalable technical content for developer tools and technical products, to create high-quality resources that teams and users actually want to use. 

### What I Do

I work with engineering teams, SaaS products, and technical organizations to build documentation and create content that supports users and grows with products. This includes documentation systems, training materials, technical blogs, and UX writing; anything that helps people understand and use technical tools.

**Core expertise:**

* Developer-facing documentation and API references
* Documentation strategy and information architecture
* Content models, style guides, and quality frameworks
* Static site generators and docs-as-code workflows
* Technical tutorials, UX writing, and technical blog content
* Cross-functional collaboration with engineering teams

### Background

I spent nine years at Unity Technologies as Senior Technical Writer and Chief Technical Editor, where I helped scale the documentation team from 4 to 80 writers and established quality standards used by 5,000+ employees. I've worked on everything from game engine documentation to company-wide style guides, and led initiatives that brought developers and writers together to improve team documentation culture.

Since then, I've worked with clients on custom prototyping tool documentation, technical training curricula, and developer platform implementations.
