## Technical Writer & Editor

Hello!

I'm a senior technical writer and editor specializing in developer tools and technical documentation. I help teams create clear, scalable documentation that supports users and grows with products.

### What I Do

I work with engineering teams, SaaS products, and technical organizations to build documentation that actually helps people. My focus is on quality, clarity, and creating systems that scale.

**Core expertise:**

* Developer-facing documentation and API references
* Documentation strategy and information architecture
* Content models, style guides, and quality frameworks
* Static site generators and docs-as-code workflows
* Cross-functional collaboration with engineering teams

### Background

I spent nine years at Unity Technologies as Senior Technical Writer and Chief Technical Editor, where I helped scale the documentation team from 4 to 80 writers and established quality standards used by 5,000+ employees. I've worked on everything from game engine documentation to company-wide style guides, and led initiatives that brought developers and writers together to improve documentation culture.

Since then, I've worked with clients on prototyping tool documentation, technical training curricula, and developer platform implementations.
