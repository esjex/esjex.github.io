## Technical Writer & Editor

Hello! I'm Siobhan (_shiv-awn_). 

I'm a senior technical writer and editor specialising in documentation and written resources for developer tools and technical products. I help teams create clear, scalable documentation and technical content that users genuinely want to use. 

### What I Do

I work with engineering teams and technical organizations to build documentation and create content that supports users and grows with products. My focus is on quality, clarity, and creating systems that scale. This includes documentation systems, training materials, technical blogs, and UX writing; anything that helps people understand and use technical tools.

**Core expertise:**

* Developer-facing documentation and API references
* Documentation strategy and information architecture
* Content models, style guides, and quality frameworks
* Static site generators and docs-as-code workflows
* Technical tutorials, UX writing, and technical blog content
* Cross-functional collaboration with engineering teams

### Background

As Senior Technical Writer and Chief Technical Editor at Unity Technologies, I helped scale the documentation team from 4 to 80 writers, as the company grew from a mid-size start-up to a large SaaS enterprise. I established documentation quality and style standards for technical communications, used by 5,000+ employees. I've worked on everything from game engine documentation to company-wide style guides, and led initiatives that brought developers and writers together to improve team documentation culture.

I'm currently working with clients on custom prototyping tool documentation, technical training curricula, and technical events documentation.

### Work with me

I’m currently available for long and short-term projects.
